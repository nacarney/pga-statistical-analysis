# pga-statistical-analysis

This was a project completed as part of a Statistical Analysis module in my 3rd Year of College. 

Methods used: 

Ridge Regression
LASSO Regression
Elastic Net Regression
Data Visualisation (Correlation Heatmap, ROCR plots)

I was tasked with choosing a dataset and research question, and then performing necessary statistical methods on the data to form results and conclusions. I chose to use the PGA Shotlink dataset. This is a dataset consisting of 2312 observations of 18 variables. The dataset is a record of various stats for 526 different golfers in the PGA Tour over the period 2010 â€“ 2018. The data was scraped from the official PGA Tour Website pgatour.com.

- Research Question:
Is it possible to reliably predict whether a particular golfer will achieve a tournament win in a
PGA Tour season, given a set of corresponding performance statistics?
